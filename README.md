# scroll-watcher
A lightweight, blazing fast, [rAF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) based, scroll watcher.

A more up-to-date approach to this **_scrolling watchers_** stuff. Slightly inspired by [scrollMonitor](https://github.com/stutrek/scrollMonitor).
